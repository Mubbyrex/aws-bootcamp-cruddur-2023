### Debugging
I learnt how to debug my error adequately before asking for help

- I learnt how to read and understand HTTP Response Status code [Study link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) 
- Though I am not experienced with python I also went over an article about Python Break points is.

Python breakpoint() is a new built-in function introduced in Python. Python code debugging has always been a painful process because of the tight coupling between the actual code and the debugging module code.
 Its helpful to use in debugging so that you can easily hook other third-party debuggers on the fly. It also provides an easy option to disable the debugger and runs the program normally.
