### Installation and Verification of AWS CLI on Gitpod

### Create a Budget and Billing Alert
I created a Zero-spend Budget because I only want to make use of the resources on free tier

and then I attached a Billing Alert to it

### Recreate Logical Architectural Design
I created a Logical Architural diagram of the Cruddur application using Lucid 

I ran in trouble because Lucid didn't have an icon for momento, which is the caching service used in the application.
I overcomed the issue by downloading the logo from the momento website and using an "image to svg" converter to convert the image before importing into Lucid
